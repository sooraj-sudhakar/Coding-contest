### Fractal analytics - String decoding
Write a program to decode a text string. The input will be just encoded string and number of rows. The encoding process is mentioned below:

     Original string=”my name is”
The string will be filled in a diagonal manner in a matrix.

</p>
The encoded string is obtained by reading row wise. The space is replaced with ‘_’ . Hence the encoded string so obtained will be`nes__ya_____mi`  

The task is to decode the encoded string back to the original string.  

    

**Sample input**  
`mnes__ya_____mi`  
`3`  

**Expected output**  
`“my name is”`
